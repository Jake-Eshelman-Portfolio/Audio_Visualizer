# LCD Audio_Visualizer
Currently in progress. I created this project to explore audio visualization on the teensy4.1 MCU, taking in audio from a microphone over I2S and using fast-fourier transforms to display audio over SPI to an LCD screen. 

# Components
- Teensy4.1
- SGTL5000 audio codec chip
- ILI9341_t3 LCD screen

# Building and Flashing
- The project was built using platform.io for VScode using the arduino framework and flashed using Teensy Loader via the platform.io inbuilt tool
